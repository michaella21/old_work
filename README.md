# old work

This repository includes some of my old codes related to data, mathematics and statistics. 
Both files with the name 'Dynamic_remaining_life...' are simple simulation file related to inventory planning based on the prediction of failure rate, which was computed based on the status of the most recent exam on each unit. 

Other files are mostly for analyzing different sizes of data sets. bikedata.py used about 120MB csv file and call_center.py used about 6.4GB csv file.
